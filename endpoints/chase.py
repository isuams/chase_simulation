"""
Chase Applet Endpoint
---------------------

Remote python backend for the chase web applet

...

! IMPORTANT !
Update the constants to their proper values, and update the shebang above to
your conda environment.

What this script does when run:

- Validates setup and POSTed team ID, speed, and direction, and if refueling
- Integrate forward position (or refuel)
- Check queue for triggered actions
- "Roll the dice" for random hazards
- Save status to database
- Return status JSON
